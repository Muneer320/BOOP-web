# Roadmap & Future Requirements

This document outlines planned enhancements, architectural improvements, and desired capabilities for the BOOP Web Frontend. It serves as a guide for contributors and future development.

## 1. Accessibility & Theming

- Achieve WCAG 2.1 compliance; add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
- Implement dark mode toggle and high‑contrast themes.
- Support custom theming (colors, fonts) via CSS variables or CSS‑in‑JS.

## 2. UI/UX Enhancements

- Improve form validation with real‑time feedback and inline error messages.
- Enhance drag‑and‑drop interactions (preview uploads before submission).
- Add live PDF preview (SVG or Canvas) of generated puzzles before download.
- Mobile‑friendly layout tweaks and touch gestures support.

## 3. State Management & Architecture

- Introduce React Context or Redux Toolkit for global state (settings, uploads).
- Refactor service calls into custom hooks for cleaner component code.
- Modularize components into atomic design pattern.

## 4. Performance Optimization

- Code‑split routes with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
- Memoize heavy components and use `useMemo`/`useCallback` where appropriate.
- Optimize images and lazy‑load non‑critical assets.

## 5. Testing & CI/CD

- Expand unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library) to cover all components.
- Add end‑to‑end tests with Cypress or Playwright.
- Integrate GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and build on PRs.

## 6. Error Handling & Monitoring

- Implement a global error boundary with fallback UI.
- Add user‑friendly error screens for network or generation failures.
- Integrate frontend logging (e.g., Sentry) for error tracking.

## 7. Analytics & User Metrics

- Integrate analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible) to track usage.
- Capture key events: uploads, generation requests, settings changes.
